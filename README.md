# An-Empirical-Study-of-Different-Intrinsic-Rewards-on-a-Partially-Observable-Multiple-Prediction-Lear
Recreate the results of https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07865v4


I acknowledge that this work is part of the course project on Reinforcement learning at the University of Alberta. Due to the time constraint and computational resource limitation, I have not been able to check every possible hyper-parameters combination for the detailed investigation of the 10 different intrinsic rewards' effectiveness in the given environmental settings. One of the reasons behind few inconsistent results between this work and Linke2019 might be the lack of considering all of the combinations of hyper-parameters.
